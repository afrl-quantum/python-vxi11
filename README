VXI-11 for python

Most was written by Spencer E. Olson <olsonse@umich.edu>
The vxi11.x file is a modified version of the one from the vxi11 for linux
package (and the author of that package borrowed it from somewhere else). 

To generate the rpc protocol for VXI-11, the vxi11.x file was parsed and
interpreted by the rpcgen.py script from 
from the newpynfs package (version 20060822).  The generated VXI-11
implementation subsequently depended on the rpc package that is also shipped
with the newpynfs package.  The newpynfs package is written by:
           Martin Murray <mmurray@deepthought.org>
and        Fred Isaman   <iisaman@citi.umich.edu>

I am including the rpc package from newpynfs here (but not rpcgen.py).
